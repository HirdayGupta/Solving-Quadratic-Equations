# Code Description
The main source code for the app can be found in the 'ViewController.swift' and 'ResultView.swift' files in the "Solving Quadratic Equations" folder. 

# App Description
The Quadratic Solver was designed with the purpose of not only assisting high school and middle school students in doing their homework but also understanding exactly how to arrive at the solutions. 

The input method and equation parser allows equations of any form, and takes into account both sides of the equality sign, so the student can enter the equation exactly as they see it in the book. The results too will be given in the same format as the textbook. Explicit instructions on how to use the app have been included.

The step-by-step solutions start with identifying the coefficients, calculating the discriminant and drawing the correct conclusion about the roots from its value. The process to find the roots is presented using both the factorisation and the formula methods for solving quadratic equations. They are beautifully laid out using the LaTeX Standard for displaying math on the web and are easy to understand. Note: Step-by-step solutions will require an internet connection to typeset and display. 

The solutions tab also displays at-a-glance solutions in both fractional and decimal representations. Note: Without an internet connection it will solve the equation and just display the decimal result.
